# MySQL-JDBC-CRUD-Data-Deletion
Project Implemented during Mysql Studies with JavaEE/JDBC to Test and Implement a Deletion Query with JDBC API Classes (Statement()) and its Methods (.executeUpdate()). The Program also implements a returnProperty method in its DB class in order to Read and Load the db.properties txt File throughout FileInput Stream and Properties Class for the JDBC API Connection. Also, it implements  a custom Exception DBIntegrityException (extending RuntimeException for faster development purposes) , which is set to treat usual DataBase Integrity Exceptions at data Deletion process, e.g the deletion of a category which is connected through a foreign key to one or more products at a product table, which foreshadows a FK error at the Database
